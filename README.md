This project demonstrates a basic fire or smoke detection system using the 8051 microcontroller and the MQ2 gas sensor. The MQ2 sensor detects the presence of smoke or combustible gases in the environment. When the concentration crosses a preset threshold, it sends a digital signal to the 8051, which then activates a buzzer to alert of the potential fire hazard.

The system uses the digital output of the MQ2 sensor, eliminating the need for an ADC (Analog-to-Digital Converter), making the circuit simple and efficient for quick deployment.
